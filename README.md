### Borg Backup Script 🤖

This repository contains a script to automate system backups with the awesome borg-backup.  

### 💻 Created by choice

I created this script with the intention of using it personally on a daily basis.

### Convenience
##### All you have to do is simply insert a USB stick, execute a one-line script, wait, and disconnect. It's really that simple!
