How to use it?

Simply:
  - open .sh with a text editor
  - change settings to desired in the user area
  - write it down
  - in the terminal, type: „sudo chmod+x script.sh”(to grant execution rights, remember the correct file path!)
  - in the terminal, type: „./script.sh” (full path, this is just an example!)
